1. Create a folder, ex. myBientropy
2. Copy the functionalized folders to it (myBientropy)
3. Download the files here to it (myBientropy)
4. Execute file **BiEntropy_best.sh**.

This files where made to be used with two Python versions at the same time, *2.7.18* for **BiEntropy.sh** and *3.10.15* for **BiEntropy_getIndex.py**.
In this case, the Python control version is done using PyEnv (Info to setup/use [here](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)).
